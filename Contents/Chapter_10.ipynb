For the present I will only say that this 'landowner'- for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate- was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest; he ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not stupidity- the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough- but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.\""

This hash code, of course, ignores half of the information present in the original key, and if many of the keys in our map only differ in these bits, then they will collide using this simple hash code.\n",

These approaches of combining components can be extended to any object $x$ whose binary representation can be viewed as an $n$-tuple $(x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1})$ of 32-bit integers, for example, by forming a hash code for $x$ as $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i}$ or as $x_0 \\bigoplus$ x_1 \\bigoplus$ \\cdots \\bigoplus x_{n-1}$, where the $\\bigoplus$ symbol represents the bitwise exclusive-or operation (which is `^` in Python)."

    "A variant of the polynomial hash coide replaces multiplcation by $a$ with a cyclic shift of a partial sum by a certain number of bits. It accomplishes the goal of varying the bits of the calculation. In Python, a cyclic shift of bits can be accomplished through careful use of the bitwise operations `<<` and `>>`, taking care to truncate result to 32-bit integers."

    "The standard mechanism for computing hash codes in Python is a built-in function with signature `hash(x)` that returns an integer value that serves as the hash code for object `x`. However, only ***immutable*** data types are deemed hashable in Python. This restriction is meant to ensure that a aparticular object's hash code remains constant during that object's lifespan. This is an important property for an object's use as as key in a hash table. A problem could occur if a key were inserted into the hash table, yet a later search were performed for that key based on a different hash code than that which it had when insereted; the wrong bucket would be searched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Python's built-in data types, the immutable `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, and `frozenset` classes produce robust hash codes, via the `hash` function, using techniques similar to those discussed earlier in this section. hash codes for character strings are well crafted based on a technique similar to polynomial hash codes, except using exclusive-or computations rather than additions. Hash codes for tuples are computed with a similar technique based upon a combination of the hash codes of the individual element of the tuple. When hashing a `frozenset`, the order of the elements should be irrelevant, and so a natural option is to compute the exclusive-or of the individual hash codes without any shifting. If `hash(x)` is called for an instance `x` of a mutable type, such as a `list`, a `TypeError` is raised."

    "Instance of user-defined classes are treated as unhashable by default, with a TypeError rasied by the `hash` function. however, a function that computes hash codes can be implemented in the form of a special method named `__hash__` within a class. The returned hash code shold reflect the immutable attributes of an instance. It is common to return a hash code that is itself based on the computed hash of the combination of such attributes. For example, a `Color` class that maintains three numberic red, green, and blue components might implement the method as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def __hash__(self):\n",
    "    return hash((self._red, self._green, self._blue))  # hash combined tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An important rule to obey is that if a class defines equivalence through `__eq__`, then any implementation of `__hash__` must be consistent, in that if `x == y`, then `hash(x) == hash(y)`. THis is important because if two instances are considered to be equivalent and one is used as a key in a hash table, a search for the second instance should result in the discovery of the first. It is therefore important that the hash code for the second match the hash code for the first, so that the proper bucket is examined. This rule extends to any well-defined comparisons betwen objects of different classes. For example, since Python treates the expression `5 == 5.0` as true, it ensures that `hash(5)` and `hash(5.0)` are the same."
